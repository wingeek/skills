## Writing Quality Standards

### The Value Triangle Model

When writing commentary, apply this framework:

1. **连接性 (Connectivity)**: Historical context
   - "This reminds me of XX technology from 10 years ago..."
   - Show depth through historical comparison

2. **批判性 (Criticality)**: Critical thinking
   - "While it claims 10x performance, in large-scale distributed scenarios it may face XX risks..."
   - Remind readers of potential pitfalls

3. **落地性 (Actionability)**: Actionable advice
   - "For small teams, wait and see; for high-concurrency scenarios, start researching now..."
   - Provide decision-making guidance

### Content Selection Criteria

**Include**:
- Technologically significant updates
- Paradigm-shifting releases
- High-quality deep dives
- Practical tools with real value
- Thought-provoking industry debates

**Exclude**:
- Marketing fluff without substance
- Minor version updates without impact
- Rumors without credible sources
- Duplicate or redundant content

## Tone and Style

- **Professional yet accessible**: Balance technical depth with readability
- **Opinionated but balanced**: Have a point of view, acknowledge alternatives
- **Evidence-based**: Support claims with data and examples
- **Forward-looking**: Connect current events to future trends
- **Reader-centric**: Always answer "What does this mean for me?"
